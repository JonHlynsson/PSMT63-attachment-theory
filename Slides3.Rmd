# Background

A securely attached infant does not need to use their cognitive resources to inquire about the availability of their caregiver, and thus are more inclined to explore (Belsky et al., 1984). 

--

Secure attachment predicts the positive development of executive functioning (Bernier et al., 2011) and higher verbal comprehension among gifted children (Wellisch et al., 2011).

--

Insecure attachment appears to be related to a lower level of cognitive performance (IJzendoorn et al., 1995).

--

Delvecchio and colleagues (2013) found that organized attachment was significantly associated with Full-Scale intelligence and Verbal intelligence scores, compared with attachment disorganization.

--

Secure attachment positively associated with *openness to experience* (Deniz, 2011; Fransson et al., 2013; Hagekull & Bohlin, 2003).

--

Openness to experience is associated with both fluid and crystalized intelligence (DeYoung et al., 2005; DeYoung et al., 2007; Schretlen et al., 2010).

???
In Delvecchio and colleagues’ (2013) study cited above, the authors do not make sense of the theoretical argumentation for an avoidant attachment style resulting in higher intelligence scores. A possible explanation for their findings is avoidant attachment’s positive association with openness to experience (Deniz, 2011), and thus indirectly intelligence.

# Study proposal

Illuminate the association between attachment and intelligence and explore the potential mediational link between attachment and intelligence through openness to experience. 

---

# Hypothesis

**Hypothesis 1**:  
a)	Organized attachment is associated with a higher Full-Scale IQ score compared with disorganized attachment.  
b)	Organized attachment is associated with a higher Verbal IQ score compared with disorganized attachment.  
c)	Secure attachment is associated with higher a Verbal IQ score compared with insecure attachment.  
d)	Secure attachment is associated with higher a Verbal IQ score compared with insecure attachment.  

--

**Hypothesis 2**:  
a)	Secure attachment is associated with higher scores in trait Openness to Experience.  
b)	Avoidant attachment is associated with higher scores in trait Openness to Experience.  
c)	A higher score in trait Openness to Experience is associated with a higher Full-Scale IQ score.  
d)	A higher score in trait Openness to Experience is associated with a higher Verbal IQ score.  

---

# Hypothesis

**Hypothesis 3**:  
a)	A higher score in Full-Scale IQ among individuals with an organized attachment is mediated by a higher score in trait Openness to Experience.  
b)	A higher score in Verbal IQ among individuals with an organized attachment is mediated by a higher score in trait Openness to Experience.  
c)	A higher score in Full-Scale IQ among securely attached individuals is mediated by a higher score in trait Openness to Experience.  
d)	A higher score in Verbal IQ among securely attached individuals is mediated by a higher score in trait Openness to Experience.

# Method


*Participants*   
University student sample. 

*Instruments*  
Experiences in close relationships-revised (ECR-R) questionnaire (Fraley et al., 2000)
Wechsler (2008) Adult Intelligence Scale – Fourth Edition (WAIS-IV) 
Goldberg’s (1999) AB5C-IPIP personality inventory.


**Other measures**  
Demographic questions:  
-	Age
-	Socioeconomic status


---

# Analysis 


Regression analysis. 

-	In all cases, covariate confounding demographic variables


For hypothesis 1, the outcome variable is the IQ score, and predictor variable is the attachment style classification.  

For hypothesis 2a and 2b, the outcome variable is AB5C-IPIP score, and the predictor variable is the attachment style classification.

For hypothesis 2c and 2d, the outcome variable is the IQ score, the predictor variable is the AB5C-IPIP score.

For hypothesis 3, the outcome variable is the IQ score, the predictor variable is the attachment style classification, and the covariate is the AB5C-IPIP score.

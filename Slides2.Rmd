Attachment security is the **primary strategy** of the attachment system:  
- associated with preferable life outcomes


40% of people are insecurely attached

???
As the primary attachment strategy, security is predictive of meaningful life outcomes such as **positive development of executive functioning**, **task-persistence** in problem solving, **effortful control**, **social competence**, **emotional understanding**, and **emotion regulation**. Consequently, *attachment security is preferable* (cf. primary strategy), and although secure attachments are the most common, approximately **40% of the population is insecurely attached**.

*Are attachment styles malleable context-dependent states or immutable implicit-dispositional traits?*

Distinction between specific behaviours and patterns of behaviour:  
- if separation protest did index amount of attachment, infants' attachment would decrease as they develop from 12- and 24-months 


<br>

Attachment behaviours are predictably influenced by the context in which they occur as opposed to reliably referring to an indexable trait-like constant across situations

<div style="text-align:right;">Masters & Wellman (1974)</div>

???
If attachment is viewed as an implicit trait (i.e., an internal phenomenon that resides in some amount within individuals), index behaviours of attachment should intercorrelate 


Stability in attachment classifications (i.e., **organized patterns of behaviour**) is the rule rather than the exception (Waters et al., 2000), but specific behaviours occurring in one context might poorly predict itself in another context

A specific attachment behaviour in context A might be a better predictor of a phenotypically different behaviour in context B then of itself. For example, proximity seeking behaviour in a distressful situation might be more predictive of positively welcoming a primary caregiver upon reunion than it is of proximity seeking in distressful situations.

.pull-left[
General continuity but lawful discontinuity

Although stability is the rule, **negative life events** predict instability in attachment classifications


Psychotherapeutic interventions facilitate attachment security


A psilocybin-assisted psychotherapeutic intervention reduced attachment-anxiety

attachment anxiety is associated with the worst outcomes in treatment

# Attachment as a State or Trait?]]


.pull-left[
Attachment as an organizational construct ≈ IWMs:  
- first socially learned experience 
- relatively stable (trait-like)




State attachment **and** trait attachment:  
- state attachment more contextually dependent 
- less variation in state attachment among securely attached individuals
- state attachment variability associated with psychological problems 
- security priming increases state attachment anxiety

social learning is the functional goal of the attachment system beyond protection

# Conclusion]]

A dichotomization of attachment as either a trait or a state is non-pragmatic and arguably wrong  

--

Attachment classifications can change over time  

--
- Thus, **not an unmalleable dispositional trait**

--

Through IWM, humans can heuristically process novelty  

--
- Thus, **not a uniformly context dependent state**

--

Attachment is **both** a malleable trait and a contextually dependent state

theory is an evolutionary based theory about the development of an affectionate
bond between a child and its caregiver (Cassidy, 2016). Coined by John Bowlby, a
psychoanalyst and psychiatrist, attachment theory draws from multiple
disciplines such as evolution, ethology, cognitive science, cybernetics, and
psychoanalysis (Granqvist, 2020). Bowlby, influenced by work with juveniles alongside
James and Joyce Robertson, noticed that infants’ facial expressions conveying
distress reliably manifested following separation from caregivers: First a face
of protest, then despair, and lastly detachment (Cassidy, 2016). Although
Bowlby was a psychoanalyst by trade (Granqvist, 2020), he doubted contemporary
theories’ ability to explain predictable manifestations of infant facial expressions
following separation. Bowlby’s doubt was supported by ethological research (cf.
Harlow and Lorenz) and notably by Anna Freud’s and Dorothy Burlingham’s
research. They learned that children left with their parents in bomb-shelters
during World War II fared better compared to children sent to the countryside
(Granqvist, 2020). In other words, proximity with caregivers reliably predicted
better adjustment in life compared exemplary nourishment (Cassidy, 2016). </span></p>

150%'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:150%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Consequently,
Bowlby emphasised the importance of continuity in caregiving and the quality
off the caregiver-infant relationship (Cassidy, 2016). Bowlby hypothesized that
humans had an innate, naturally selected, attachment system that desired security
with an attachment figure (usually the mother) though physical proximity (Cassidy,
2016). To obtain proximity with the attachment system, the child engages in
various attachment behaviours. For example, a child’s locomotive behaviours
(e.g., approaching and following) are active attachment behaviours increase the
child’s proximity to the mother (Cassidy, 2016).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:3.0pt;text-indent:36.0pt;line-height:
150%'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:150%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Bowlby
proposed that during the course of human evolution, the attachment system had
evolved in the environment of evolutionary adaptedness where proximity-seeking
behaviours with a caregiver were favoured in the genetic selection. In turn,
such behaviours increased the likelihood of protection by a stronger and wiser
attachment figure, and thus were advantageous for survival. Bowlby referred to
such protection as a biological function of attachment behaviours because
infants innately predisposed to seek proximity with their caregivers in the
environment of evolutionary adaptedness were less likely to be killed by
predators (Bretherton, 1992). Consequently, claiming humans to be pre-wired for
attachment is underpinned in evolutionary science and further supported by
Bowlby’s identification that attachment forms even to abusive mothers (Cassidy,
2016).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:3.0pt;text-indent:36.0pt;line-height:
150%'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:150%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Notably,
the attachment relationship between infant and caregiver is asymmetrical. The
attached child forms an affectionate bond (i.e., attachment relationship) with
an attachment figure who is perceived as stronger and wiser. Moreover, the
child looks to their attachment figure in times of distress (i.e., as a safe
haven) and as a point of departure for exploration (i.e., as a secure base). As
noted, this attachment relationship is characterized by physical proximity
maintenance and separation distress. Additionally, the attached child engages
is secure base and safe haven behaviours (Bretherton, 1992; Cassidy, 2016). </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:3.0pt;text-indent:36.0pt;line-height:
150%'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:150%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>The
attachment system facilitates attachment relationship formation and children
appear to be born with sophisticated perceptual abilities that facilitate
attachment (Cassidy, 2016). In that sense, the attachment system operates in
synchrony with at least two other biological systems: The fear system and
exploration system. In relation to the fear system, Bowlby noted that when
afraid, children not only run away from something (e.g., danger) but also
towards something else (e.g., comfort). All things equal, the attachment figure
provides a <i>safe haven</i> that the attached child can seek out in times of
distress. In that sense, a safe haven refers the attachment figure being
responsive and sensitive to the attached child’s signalling of distress. In
other words, a safe haven is the place to which the attached child returns to when
experiencing distress. In relation to the exploration system, Mary Ainsworth’s
framework of a <i>secure base</i> from which the attached child feels free to explore
from best captures the complimentary functions of the attachment and
exploration systems (Bretherton, 1992). Thus, a secure base relates to the attached
trusting that they have someone to return to after exploratory adventures. In
order to provide a secure base, the attachment figure must support exploration
by encouraging and accepting exploration, being available if needed, and not unnecessarily
interrupt the exploratory adventures (Cassidy, 2016). </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:3.0pt;text-indent:36.0pt;line-height:
150%'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:150%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>The
development of the attachment relationship can roughly be divided into four
stages: The first phase lasts around 8-12 weeks and is characterized by
extensive attachment signalling without discrimination. The second phase then
lasts until the child is around 6-9-months-old and is characterized by more discriminative
signalling at one or more attachment figures whom are perceived as most likely
to provide stability. In the third phase, lasting until the child is around
3-years-old, the child learns to regulate their proximity to a discriminative attachment
figure through their own locomotion (Zeifman &amp; Hazan, 2016). It should be
noted that attachment formation has a sensitive period in the child’s first
year; if attachment has not formed by then, a maladaptive attachment is
likelier to develop. Other things equal, all normal humans attach to their
primary caregiver within the first 8-months of life (Zeifman &amp; Hazan, 2016)
and thus, somewhat unsurprisingly, a prototypical attachment relationship has usually
manifested when the child is 1-years-old (Cassidy, 2016). Lastly, in the fourth
phase, interactions between the attached and attachment figure become
characterized by communication (e.g., about shared goals) and negotiation; the
child develops a theory of mind; and a goal-corrected partnership continuously
develops from when the child is approximately 3-years-old and onwards (Zeifman
&amp; Hazan, 2016).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:3.0pt;text-indent:36.0pt;line-height:
150%'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:150%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Although
a full-fledged attachment relationship has developed when the child is
1-years-old (Cassidy, 2016), the quality of attachment individually differs. Most
broadly, attachment relationships can be conceived of as either <i>secure</i>
or <i>insecure</i>. A further differentiation can then be made within insecure
attachments where <i>anxious/resistant</i> attachments differ from <i>avoidant</i>
attachments. The three types of attachment relationships just listed make up
the organized attachment styles identified by Mary Ainsworth (Bretherton, 1992).
</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:3.0pt;text-indent:36.0pt;line-height:
150%'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:150%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>A
<i>secure</i> attachment is marked by a dynamic interplay between exploration
and attachment behaviours. A securely attached child feels free to explore the
world but trusts the availability of the attachment figure, and thus eagerly
seeks contact with their attachment figure upon experiencing distress or after
brief separation. Notably, a secure attachment is the attachment style most
likely to remain stable over time and predicts later socioemotional functions
and executive functioning. The key element for developing security is caregiver
sensitivity and availability. Caregiver sensitivity refers to how a caregiver
interprets and responds to the attachment signalling and through caregiver
sensitivity, the child learns what to expect in terms of availability of
others; both in relation to attachment and exploration. However, if the
attachment figure is ambivalent to the child’s needs or unavailable (e.g.,
rejects the child), the child minimizes their attachment signalling and
develops an <i>avoidant </i>attachment. Thus, avoidantly attached children do
not display much attachment signalling when separated from caregivers and
reject their attachment figures upon reunion (e.g., mother’s occupational
duties could be perceived as rejective, and in turn facilitate attachment
avoidance). Avoidantly attached children have a mental representation (a.k.a.,
internal-working-model) of the attachment figure being unavailable and operate
in the world accordingly (Cassidy, 2016). </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:3.0pt;text-indent:36.0pt;line-height:
150%'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:150%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>In
contrast to a minimization of attachment signalling among avoidantly attached
children, <i>anxious/resistant</i> attachment is characterized by a sort of
hyperactive attachment signalling. This maximization of attachment signalling
is the consequence of inconsequential experiences from caregivers, making
infants unsure of what to expect. Such uncertainty has been associated with parents’
own childhood-attachment anxiety (Main &amp; Hesse, 1990). Anxiously attached
children have a low threshold of attachment activation, are less likely to be
exploratory, and sometimes thought of as clingy. The minimized and maximized
attachment signalling of avoidantly and anxiously attached children,
respectively, likely acts as a self-fulfilling prophecy. That is, by
anticipating rejection, more rejection is likely manifested which in turn
reinforces avoidant attachment; by extensive clinginess, inconsequential
responses likely manifest which in turn reinforce anxious attachment (Cassidy,
2016). Thus, behavioural manifestations of attachment behaviour are
context-specific insofar as children react differently to distress and danger
depending on the availability and sensitivity of caregivers (Crowell et al.,
2016).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:3.0pt;text-indent:36.0pt;line-height:
150%'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:150%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>It
should be noted that a principal attachment figure is not interchangeable. In
other words, no number of friends or relatives can make up for the loss of a
principal attachment figure, a tendency Bowlby termed monotropy. Consequently,
such a loss increases the likelihood of developing an insecure attachment
style. Furthermore, contextual factors such as socioeconomic risk are
predictive of insecure attachment development (Cassidy, 2016). Maternal- and
parental satisfaction are associated with security (Bretherton, 1992), but caregiver
sensitivity appears to affect security formation the most. For caregivers to
provide sensitivity, the caregiving system must activate. Such activation
depends on both internal cues (e.g., hormones and parental state) and external
cues (e.g., perceived environmental danger and infant state/behaviour); without
caregiving system activation infants cannot survive. Ethologists have even
proposed that infants’ babyish features evolved to activate the caregiving
system (Cassidy, 2016).</span></p>

theory of attachment has required little-to-no modification from its original
formulation. Such a feat is uncommon within a scientific discipline advancing
at a high phase like psychology, making his contribution that much more remarkable
(Granqvist, 2020). </span></p>

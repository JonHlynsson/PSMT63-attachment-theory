<p class=Body>John Bowlby (1969/1982) conceived of the attachment system as an
innate, evolutionary evolved, behavioural system. According to Bowlby, the
attachment system preferentially seeks security with a principal attachment
figure through physical proximity. However, obtaining security is largely
dependent on the provision of sensitivity from a primary caregiver (Cassidy, 2016)
and is only successfully acquired in approximately 60% of the population (Bakermans-Kranenburg
&amp; van IJzendoorn, 2009; Mickelson et al., 1997). When the primary strategy
of the attachment system (i.e., seeking security through proximity) repeatedly fails,
children increasingly adopt <i>secondary strategies</i> to orient themselves in
the world (Main, 1990; Mikulincer, 2019). According to Mary Main (1990),
secondary strategies are characterized by either a minimization (i.e., <i>avoidant</i>
attachment behaviours) or hyperactivation (i.e., <i>anxious</i> attachment
behaviours) of attachment signalling as a result of ambivalent or
inconsequential caregiver sensitivity, respectively (Crowell et al., 2016; Main
&amp; Hesse, 1990). </p>

<p class=Body>Despite their label, secondary attachment strategies carry
evolutionary advantages. For example, the self-reliant behaviour characteristic
of avoidant attachment enables a child to maintain relative proximity to
overwhelmed caregivers without driving them away (Main, 1981; Simpson &amp;
Belsky, 2016). Moreover, avoidant tendencies can both motivate children to
separate earlier from abusive parents as well as facilitate opportunistic
behaviour, and thereby increase the likelihood of survival and successful
reproduction (Belsky, 1997; Simpson &amp; Belsky, 2016). By the same token,
demanding attachment behaviours displayed by anxiously attached children may
reflect an ecologically contingent strategy that aims to bolster the quality of
parental care, and thus increase the child’s likelihood of survival (Cassidy
&amp; Berlin, 1994; Simpson &amp; Belsky, 2016). Stated differently, the hyperactivation
of attachment signalling displayed by anxiously attached children may be an
evolutionarily evolved strategy that maximizes a child’s likelihood of survival
in neglectful environments. Indeed, anxiously attached children are
comparatively more likely to have been victims of parental neglect (Simpson
&amp; Belsky, 2016; Youngblade &amp; Belsky, 1989).</p>

<p class=Body>As the primary attachment strategy, security is predictive of
meaningful life outcomes such as positive development of executive functioning
(Bernier et al., 2011), task-persistence in problem solving (Matas et al.,
1978), effortful control (Viddal et al., 2015), social competence (Groh et al.,
2016), emotional understanding (Raikes &amp; Thompson, 2006), and emotion
regulation (Kerns et al., 2007). Consequently, attachment security is
preferable (cf. primary strategy), and although secure attachments are the most
common, approximately 40% of the population is insecurely attached (Bakermans-Kranenburg
&amp; van IJzendoorn, 2009; Mickelson et al., 1997). Given the positive
life-outcomes associated with security and high proportion of insecurity, one
naturally wonders whether attachment styles are malleable context-dependent
states or immutable implicit-dispositional traits. In this paper, I aim to
illuminate the attachment construct with regard to attachment malleability and
contextual dependency. To do so, I will argue that attachment should first and
foremost be conceived of as an organizational construct (Sroufe &amp; Waters,
1997).</p>

<h2>Attachment: An Organisational Construct</h2>

<p class=Body>Bowlby (1969/1982) proposed that during the course of human
evolution, the attachment system had evolved in the environment of evolutionary
adaptedness (EEA) where proximity-seeking behaviours with a caregiver were
favoured in the genetic selection (i.e., attachment behaviours; Bretherton,
1992). Thus, to obtain physical proximity with an attachment figure, the child engages
in various attachment behaviours (e.g., approaching and following the principal
attachment figure via locomotion; Cassidy, 2016). Importantly, interpreting the
meaning of a behavioural expression is dependent on the context in which the
behaviour manifests (Sroufe &amp; Waters, 1997). Stated differently, the same
behavioural expression can have multiple meanings (e.g., Harrington et al.,
1996), which in turn implies that determining whether behaviour <i>A</i> is
properly a member of class <i>X</i> (e.g., proximity-seeking behaviours) necessitates
a behavioural and situational context consideration. The same behavioural expression
might act as a means to seek proximity in one context, but as a marker of
avoidance in another. For instance, most children turn away from their
attachment figure when their nose is wiped, which does not necessarily indicate
avoidance, but such a response (i.e., turning away from an attachment figure)
might predict avoidance in the context of support-seeking (i.e., safe haven)
behaviours (Sroufe &amp; Waters, 1997). </p>

<p class=Body>The distinction between specific behaviours and patterns of
behaviour is important, not least because presumed behavioural-specific indexes
of attachment intercorrelate poorly, do not show temporal stability, and are
contextually dependent (Coates et al., 1972; Masters &amp; Wellman, 1974). If
attachment is viewed as an implicit trait (i.e., an internal phenomenon that
resides in some amount within individuals), index behaviours of attachment
should intercorrelate (Sroufe &amp; Waters, 1997). As noted above,
behavioural-specific indexes of attachment do not intercorrelate highly (Coates
et al., 1972; Masters &amp; Wellman, 1974), and even amount of proximity
seeking or separation protest behaviours, “hallmarks of attachment,” cannot index
amount of attachment; proximity seeking and separation protest behaviours are
markers of the quality of attachment only when the behavioural manifestation is
viewed with respect to its organization within specific contexts and other
behaviours. For example, if separation protest did index amount of attachment,
infants' attachment would decrease as they develop from 12- and 24-months (Sroufe
&amp; Waters, 1997). </p>

<p class=Body>Viewing attachment styles as implicit traits is not indispensable
to attachment theory; the trait-view of attachment arose from the social
learning theory of dependency when researchers studied caregiver-infant
interactions (Ainsworth, 1969; Maccoby, 2007). Importantly, Bowlby (1969/1982)
bypassed constraints related to causal trait terminology and drive reduction conceptualizations
by casting attachment theory in systems theory of set goals, goal correction,
and function (Granqvist, 2020a; Sroufe &amp; Waters, 1997). In Bowlby’s view,
attachment can best be conceptualized as an affectionate tie between an
attached child and their attachment figure that relies on a flexible
behavioural system that is a) operating in terms of set goals, b) interaction
with other behavioural systems, and c) mediated by emotion (Bowlby 1969/1982;
Sroufe &amp; Waters, 1997). Consequently, attachment behaviours are predictably
influenced by the context in which they occur as opposed to reliably referring
to an indexable trait-like constant across situations (Sroufe &amp; Waters,
1997).</p>

<p class=Body>Bowlby (1969/1982) hypothesized attachment related patterns of
behaviour to be stable over time, not the specific behavioural expressions.
Indeed, stability in attachment classifications (i.e., organized patterns of
behaviour) is the rule rather than the exception (Waters et al., 2000), but
specific behaviours occurring in one context might poorly predict itself in
another context. Instead, a specific attachment behaviour in context <i>A</i>
might be a better predictor of a phenotypically different behaviour in context <i>B</i>
then of itself (Sroufe &amp; Waters, 1997). For example, proximity seeking
behaviour in a distressful situation might be more predictive of positively
welcoming a primary caregiver upon reunion than it is of proximity seeking in
distressful situations (Sroufe &amp; Waters, 1997). Indeed, an adaptive
attachment relationship is characterized by a predictable change in the
organization of adaptive behaviour. Conceiving of the affectionate bond
characteristic of attachment as reliant on an adaptive and flexible behavioural
system presupposes that the attached figure has mastered the coordination of a
wide variety of adaptive goal-correcting behavioural responses (Sroufe &amp;
Waters, 1997). In agreement with Bowlby’s (1969/1982) hypothesis, the
organization of adaptive behavioural patterns that mark attachment quality
appear stable over time, but not the specific behavioural expressions (Sroufe
&amp; Waters, 1997; Waters et al., 2000).</p>

<h2>Attachment Malleability </h2>

<p class=Body>Bowlby (1969/1982) expected attachment styles to become more
resistant to change over time (i.e., general continuity), but also claimed
change to be possible, especially in unstable, chastising environments (i.e.,
lawful discontinuity). Indeed, as noted above, stability in attachment
classifications is the rule rather than the exception (Waters et al., 2000),
but negative life events such as child maltreatment and maternal depression
predict instability in attachment (Weinfield et al., 2000). In one study examining
attachment style changes among individuals with post-traumatic stress disorder
(PTSD), treatment group participants were more likely to move from an insecure
attachment style to security following an intensive 8-week-long group
psychotherapy (i.e., compared to moving from security to insecurity; Muller
&amp; Rosenkranz, 2009). </p>

<p class=Body>In another more recent study, psilocybin-assisted
psychotherapeutic intervention reduced attachment-anxiety substantially and the
effect was enduring (i.e., almost 4 months after a single psilocybin session;
Stauffer et al., 2021; but see also Cherniak et al., 2021). The reduction of
anxious attachment is notable as in psychotherapy, attachment-anxiety is
associated with the worst treatment outcomes and can be detrimental to treatment
efficacy (e.g., Levy et al., 2010; McBride et al., 2006; but see also Slade,
2016). Thus, conceiving of attachment as a malleable phenomenon is an
empirically supported notion, not least in times of emotional distress and
crisis (Weinfield et al., 2000; but see also Granqvist, 2020b), but also
psychotherapy and related clinical interventions (Muller &amp; Rosenkranz,
2009; Stauffer et al., 2021). Importantly, the examples cited here barely
scratch the surface of the vast empirically backed interventions shown to
increase and/or facilitate attachment security (for review, see e.g., Wright
&amp; Edginton, 2016).</p>

<h2>Attachment as a State or Trait</h2>

<p class=Body>As noted above, organized patterns of behaviour that typify
attachment quality remain relatively stable over time (Sroufe &amp; Waters,
1997; Waters et al., 2000). Attachment quality is established through
attachment-related experiences (e.g., separations from mother; Cassidy et al.,
2013). Following repeated attachment-related experiences, children conjure up a
<i>mental representation</i> of their attachment figure, themselves, and their
environment (Cassidy, 2016; Bretherton, 1992). Stated differently, a mental representation
is akin to a mental image that consists of the child’s expectations and
knowledge about the world, based on their attachment-related experiences. Thus,
one could conceive of a mental representation as an internal marker of
attachment quality. Bowlby (1969/1982) referred to such mental representations
as internal-working-models (IWMs) that govern and guide organized attachment
behavioural patterns as children grow older (Fraley, 2007). Furthermore, threat
appraisal in novel circumstances; including behavioural organization and
formation; is guided by IWMs (Cassidy et al., 2013). </p>

<p class=Body>As noted above, the attachment system includes both to a
behavioural system (i.e., organized patterns of behaviour) and a cognitive
component (i.e., IWMs; Cassidy, 2016). It is conceivable to ideate IWMs as akin
to a trait-like phenomenon; given the qualifications outlined above (i.e.,
attachment as an organizational construct); which aids heuristic processing of
the environment so an appropriate behavioural response can be employed (Bretherton
&amp; Munholland, 2016). In that view, attachment can be conceptualized as the
composition of both a stable, trait-like component, and a contextually variable
state-like component–a viewpoint which has gained a fair bit of empirical
support (Fraley, 2007; Verhees et al., 2021). Although the trait-like component
of attachment is commonly conceptualized as a stable feature (Sroufe &amp;
Waters, 1997; Waters et al., 2000), more variation, on average, appears to characterize
the state-like attachment component (Bosmans et al., 2014; Verhees et al.,
2021). </p>

<p class=Body>However, trait attachment and state attachment interact with each
other such that more securely attached children at the trait level appear to
vary less in their state attachment (Bosmans et al., 2014; Verhees et al.,
2021). Indeed, securely attached children’s knowledge of a reliably sensitive
and responsive caregiver eventually crystallize in a so-called
secure-base-script (Waters &amp; Waters, 2006) as the first truly social
learning experience (Sroufe &amp; Waters, 1997). It has even been suggested
that social learning is the functional consequence of attachment beyond
protection that is facilitated by security (Granqvist, 2020b). As a result of
insecurity being associated with a greater variability in state attachment
(Bosmans et al., 2014; Verhees et al., 2021), and increased state attainment
variability being associated with psychological problems (Verhees et al.,
2021), it has been suggested that clinical interventions aiming to alleviate
such problems should reduce state attachment variability (Verhees et al.,
2021). However, it remains to be fully seen how such interventions could be
practically implemented. For instance, interventions making use of security
priming; which is generally associated with beneficial effects on various
variables such as aggression, depression, compassion, and altruism (for review
see Gillath &amp; Karantzas, 2019); appear to <i>increase</i> state attainment
anxiety (Stevenson et al., 2021). Thus, given that state attachment anxiety increases
following a security prime, but a reduced state attachment variability might
act as a protective factor against psychological problems, apparent
contradictory findings need to be reconciled before a large-scale
implementation can be conceived of.  </p>

0cm;text-indent:0cm'><span lang=en-SE>Conclusion</span></h1>

<p class=Body>If one attempts to dichotomize attachment as an either trait-like
or state-like phenomenon, one is arguably approaching the question both non-pragmatically
and from a wrong angle. As noted above, attachment both has a state-like and a
trait-like component (Bosmans et al., 2014; Verhees et al., 2021), which likely
is testament to the adaptability of humans. If attachment were an unmalleable dispositional
trait, negative life events would not interfere with its organization, but they
do (Weinfield et al., 2000), which increases the likelihood of survival in
aversive environments (Belsky, 1997; Simpson &amp; Belsky, 2016; Youngblade
&amp; Belsky, 1989). Likewise, if attachment were uniformly contextually
dependent (i.e., a state), every novel and potentially threatening situation
would demand a novel interpretation and evaluation. Stated differently, there
would be no heuristically guided processing (i.e., no IWMs), meaning that
individuals would not have a mental representation to rely on in novel
circumstances (Cassidy et al., 2013; Bretherton &amp; Munholland, 2016).
Lastly, as already implied, attachment organization is malleable, not least through
psychotherapeutic interventions (Muller &amp; Rosenkranz, 2009; Stauffer et al.,
2021). In summary, one could neither claim attachment to exclusively be a trait
nor state, it is both. </p>
